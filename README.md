## Process
- Data is collected Age, Gender, Income Level, education, bike purchased or not, No. of cars, etc.
- Data preparation, clean and organize data , ensuring all relevant fields are available for analysis.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.
- Analyze the visualized data to uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities for optimization, and summarize key insights with actionable recommendations to enhance business performance.

## Project Insight
- Customers with shorter commutes are more likely to buy bikes, with the highest purchase rate .
  Bike purchases drop significantly for customers with commutes longer than 5 miles, suggesting that distance is a key factor in purchasing decisions.

- Higher-income customers are more likely to buy bikes, indicating that affordability plays a role in purchase decisions.
  Males have a higher average income than females, and income disparity impacts bike purchase rates more for males than for females.

- Middle-aged customers (30–50 years old) have the highest bike purchase rate.
  Adolescents and older customers are less likely to buy bikes, possibly due to financial constraints and physical limitations, respectively.

- Customers with fewer cars (0–1) are more likely to buy bikes.
  As the number of cars owned increases (2 or more), bike purchases decrease significantly, indicating that customers with more cars do not see biking as a necessity.

- Customers with moderate commute distances, higher incomes, and middle-aged demographics are the most likely to buy bikes.

## Final Conclusion
- Focus marketing efforts on middle-aged buyers by emphasizing comfort, durability, etc.
- Highlight biking as a convenient and healthy alternative for customers with commutes of 0–5 miles.
- Develop campaigns showcasing premium bike features that appeal to higher-income individuals.
- Offer affordable, trendy options for adolescents and comfort-oriented designs for older customers.
- Market bikes as cost-effective and sustainable alternatives for customers with fewer cars while promoting recreational biking to those with multiple cars.
- Segment customers based on demographics, income, commute patterns, and car ownership to optimize sales and customer engagement.
